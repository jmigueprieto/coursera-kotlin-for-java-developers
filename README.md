# Kotlin for Java Developers

This repo contains my solutions to the assignments given in [Kotlin for Java Developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/kotlin-for-java-developers).

I have to say it's a very good introductory course to Kotlin. It's offered by JetBrains and one of the instructors is [Andrey Breslav](https://twitter.com/abreslav), the Lead Language Designer of Kotlin. In several videos he explains many of the design decisions, e.g.: the importance of extension functions, nullability and nullable types vs optionals.

## Assignments

The assignments can be obtained through JetBrains EduTools plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.

In each assignment you will find a task description (in a file task.md)
